## About:
* This is the PONG game that most people should know of, rules are also below for those who do not know.
* You are playing against a bot that is not very smart
* The game will determine a winner after 10 rounds or when the end game button is pressed

## How to Play:
1. Move the paddle with the arrow keys
2. try to bounce the ball back with the paddle avoiding it from touching your end of the wall
3. score a point by making the ball touch the opponent's wall
4. The ball does not reflect based on the incoming angle to the paddle but instead its contact point with the paddle
    - Hitting the upper portions of the paddle will result in the ball going upwards, same applies for lower section
    - It also scales with how up or low you hit the paddle
